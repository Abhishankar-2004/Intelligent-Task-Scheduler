## 📌 Project Overview

The **Intelligent Task Scheduler** is a smart desktop productivity application built for students, developers, and small teams. Unlike basic to-do lists, this tool integrates AI to recommend and prioritize tasks based on user habits and task urgency.

Think of it as a mini personal assistant—always suggesting, reminding, and helping you stay on top of your goals.

### ✨ Key Functionalities

- ✅ **Full CRUD Operations** – Manage tasks with title, description, deadline, priority, and duration.
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Recommendations** – Alerts for urgent tasks and smart scheduling based on your behavior.
- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard** – Visual insights into your task stats and performance.
- ☁️ **Cloud Data Sync** – Connects to a backend server for centralized data and cross-device potential.
- 🎨 **Modern UI** – Built with JavaFX for a sleek, responsive interface.
